Letâ€™s say we have a warehouse, that contains following things with expiry dates: 
- Carrot that will expire in 30 days, 
- Potato for 45 days, 
- Rice for 100 Days and 
- Spinach can be used in 5 days. 

So to deliver these items, we must sell these items as per the ascending order of their names (expiry we will take care
of later).

So the order should be:

Item        Expiry in days
--------------------------
Carrot      30
Spinach     5
Rice        100
Potato      45

Expected:
--------------------------
Carrot      30
Potato      45
Rice        100
Spinach     5
