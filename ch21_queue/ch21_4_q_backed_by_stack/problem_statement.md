Implement the Queue using stacks. The queue methods ou need to implement are 
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek
- Empty

Empty: returns a boolean value of whether the Q is empty or not.

Constraints:
- Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform at the same complexity of a real queue?
  - No, but they should be as performant as possible.
