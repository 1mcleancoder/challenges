Given an unsorted array, return the kth largest element. It is the Kth largest element in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

[5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2] == sorted ==> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 
2th largest number => 5

[2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2] == sorted ==> [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]
4th largest number => 2

Constraints: 
- Is K is always within limits of the input array?
  - Yes, it is always within limits.
